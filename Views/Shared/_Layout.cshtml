            <li><h4>Short description of what layout does</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A common <b>layout</b> provides user with a consistent experience as they navigate from page to page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Layout file allows us to reuse portions of View content(common elements) instead of implementing these visual elements on every page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For Eg. no need to code website header or footer more than once or to have same JavaScript statements in every view file
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Why do you put the files in those directories. E.g., CSS in directory x, and why. Layout in directory Y and why. Etc. </h4>
                The reason for putting the files in different directories is to achieve bvetter organization and easy maintanance of the project because of the following reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Having these files in separate files means making changes to one won't mess with the contents of the other, and so modifying, and troubleshooting in case of an error becomes easier.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Having a separate CSS file means you can reuse the style across multiple views and maintain consistency of the web app and the same goes for the layout files
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </footer>
